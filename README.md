# Contained

A native, SwiftUI-first macOS app for Apple's [`container`](https://github.com/apple/container) CLI — a Liquid Glass control surface for running, customizing, and inspecting Linux containers on Apple silicon. It covers the everyday Docker-Desktop workflow plus the broader `container` command surface, without leaving the Mac-native look and feel.

> **Status:** feature-complete, polishing toward 1.0. Every section below is implemented; see the [1.0 Polish Checklist](#10-polish-checklist) for the per-screen pass that remains before tagging a stable release.

## Highlights

- **Grid of glass cards** — each container is a clear Liquid Glass card with a customizable tint, gradient, icon, nickname, an app-managed health badge, and a selectable live sparkline (CPU / memory / network / disk).
- **Full lifecycle + 7 detail tabs** — start/stop/restart, plus Overview, Logs, Terminal (SwiftTerm), Stats, History, Files, and Inspect for each container.
- **Images, Build, Volumes, Networks, Registries, System** — pull (with Docker Hub search), build (streamed BuildKit log), tag/push/save/load, filesystem export, volume/network CRUD, registry login, service control, `df`, a Prune Center, and guarded kernel/DNS management.
- **Templates & Stacks** — a library of saved run recipes plus built-in starters, and `compose.yaml` import with app-managed start-order and health-gated launch.
- **One Edit form** — progressive-disclosure mapping of the `container run` flags with host-bounded CPU/RAM controls and a live "reveal the CLI" preview.
- **Persistent history** — SwiftData-backed events and metrics power a per-container History tab and a system-wide Activity view (Swift Charts), with configurable retention.
- **App-managed restart & healthchecks** — `container` has no native `--restart` or healthcheck, so Contained runs both itself.
- **Mac-native throughout** — `NavigationSplitView`, the system search field, a section-aware Liquid Glass toolbar, a command palette (⌘K), a menu-bar extra, full keyboard shortcuts, and accessibility (Reduce Transparency / Reduce Motion / VoiceOver). AppKit bridges are used only where SwiftUI has no equivalent, and are flagged in the source.

## Install & updates

Download the latest `.dmg` from [Releases](https://github.com/tdeverx/contained-app/releases). Updates are delivered in-app via [Sparkle](https://sparkle-project.org) across three channels, selectable in Settings → Updates:

- **Stable** — finished releases.
- **Beta** — pre-release builds, ahead of stable.
- **Nightly** — the latest build from every commit (CI), bleeding edge.

Channels are cumulative (Nightly still receives Beta and Stable). See [docs/Release.md](docs/Release.md) for the maintainer release/signing/notarization flow.

## Requirements

- macOS 26 or later (Apple silicon)
- Xcode 26 / Swift 6.2+
- Apple's `container` CLI **1.0.0** installed and on `PATH` ([install](https://github.com/apple/container))

## Build & run

This is a Swift Package — open it directly in Xcode (there is no `.xcodeproj`):

```sh
open Package.swift        # opens the package as a project in Xcode
```

Or from the command line:

```sh
swift build               # compile
swift test                # run the unit tests
./scripts/bundle.sh       # assemble a runnable Contained.app
open Contained.app        # launch it
```

## Architecture

The package splits into two targets so all logic is testable without a UI:

- **`ContainedCore`** (library) — models, the `container` CLI wrapper (`--format json`), lenient decoders grounded against captured real CLI output, and command builders. No UI.
- **`Contained`** (executable) — the SwiftUI app: design system, stores (`@Observable` + `@MainActor`), feature views, and the SwiftData history store.

Integration is by **shelling out** to the `container` CLI and decoding its JSON, rather than linking a private framework — robust across CLI updates and easy to verify. Personalization (tint, icon, nickname, background) is stored **locally** (image-keyed defaults + per-container overrides) and never written back as container labels, keeping the CLI clean.

## 1.0 Polish Checklist

Every screen gets the same pass before tagging 1.0. Criteria per page: **G** Liquid Glass consistency · **S** empty / loading / error states · **A** keyboard + VoiceOver accessibility · **C** Reveal-CLI on privileged actions · **L** copy / labels / info-popovers · **R** responsive layout.
